# baucis

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/baucis.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/baucis/)

> Build scalable REST APIs using the open source tools and standards you and your team already know â€” *Mongoose, Express, and Node.js streams*. 

Baucis takes the boilerplate out of building and maintaining scalable [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)/[Level 3](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) REST APIs.


:warning: This is a from the Coorpacademy Tech team :warning:
This is so far intended for intern use

## Features

 * Automatically build controllers from your Mongoose schemata, then easily configure them.
 * Built on Express 4 so adding custom middleware is a snap.  Compatible with existing Express middleware.
 * Fully takes advantage of Node.js streaming to nimbly process large datasets.
 * Implements the HTTP specification according to the specifications ([RFC 7231](http://tools.ietf.org/rfcmarkup/7231), etc.)
 * Widely compatible with a variety of front end frameworks.
 * Perform rich queries of the API using an expressive JSON syntax via query string.
 * Supports geolocation and full text search.
 * Version your API using semver.
 * Automatically generate interactive Swagger documentation for the API.
 * Highly customizable, simple interface.  Can be extended with plugins (decorators).
 * Compatible with MongoDB 2.x and 3.x
 * Over 140 Mocha.js tests in addition to Express' and Mongoose's.


## Getting Started

To install:

    npm install --save baucis

It's easy to create an API from a Mongoose model:

``` javascript
// Create a mongoose schema.
var Vegetable = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String });
// Register new models with mongoose.
mongoose.model('vegetable', Vegetable);
// Create a simple controller.  By default these HTTP methods
// are activated: HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
baucis.rest('vegetable');
// Create the app and listen for API requests
var app = express();
app.use('/api', baucis());
app.listen(8012);
```

That's it!  Now you have an RFC-compliant, flexible, and semantically rich API dealing with vegetables.  You could access it with URLs like `http://localhost:8012/api/vegetables`.  CRUD is supported using [GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE](https://github.com/wprl/baucis/wiki/HTTP-Verbs).
